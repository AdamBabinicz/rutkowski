      "paragraph1": "The Jacek Malczewski State Art Center in Radom is an institution with a rich history, founded in 1945 by the painter Wacław Dobrowolski. For decades, it was located in the historic Glogier Tenement House, becoming the heart of the city's artistic life. Its goal has always been to provide artistic education for children, youth, and adults, developing their talents and preparing them for further education at art universities.",
      "paragraph2": "The foundation of the Center was its outstanding educators. Alongside the founder, Prof. Dobrowolski, key roles were played by artists such as Irena Cichowska, who passionately shared their knowledge and skills. It is thanks to them that the Center gained a reputation as a place where true talents were born in an atmosphere of creativity and respect for art.",
      "paragraph3": "Many distinguished artists passed through the walls of the school that gave rise to the Center. Among others, Andrzej Wajda, later a world-famous film director and Oscar winner, took drawing lessons from Wacław Dobrowolski himself. Zbigniew Rutkowski is one of the many alumni for whom studying at the Center was a decisive step on their artistic path."
